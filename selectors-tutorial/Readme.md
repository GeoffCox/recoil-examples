# Recoil Selectors Tutorial

This example is the To Do list application described in the selectors tutorial: https://recoiljs.org/docs/basic-tutorial/selectors. 

- This example demonstrates the use of selector() and useRecoilValue().
- This example is based on atoms-example.
- Like the previous example project, the code has been updated to use Typescript:
  - The todoListFilterState uses a fixed set of possible string values defined as the TodoFilter type.
  - Updated functions to the lambda form
  - Updated event handlers to use event types

**To run this example**

1. Install dependencies and build
```
npm install
npm run build
```

2. Open dist/index.html in a browser -or- in VSCode launch the debug task.
